<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Macros are processor directive which will be replaced at compile time.<br>
	The disadvantage with macros is that they just replace the code they are not function calls. similarly the advantage is they can reduce time for replacing the same values.</font><br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">8.<b>Difference between pass by reference and pass by value?&nbsp;</b></font><br>
	<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">Pass by value just passes the value from caller to calling function so the called function cannot modify the values in caller function. But Pass by reference will pass the address to the caller function instead of value if called function requires to modify any value it can directly modify.</span><br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Structure: Initially (in C) a structure was used to bundle different type of data types together to perform a particular functionality. But C++ extended the structure to contain functions also.&nbsp;<br>
	The major difference is that all declarations inside a structure are by default public.<br>
	Class: Class is a successor of Structure. By default all the members inside the class are private.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><u> <font color="#000000"> </font> <b> <font color="#000000">Function overloading</font> </b> </u>is a feature of C++ that allows us to create multiple functions with the same name, so long as they have different parameters.Consider the following function:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; int Add(int nX, int nY)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return nX + nY;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>15.What is function overloading and operator overloading?</b><br>
	<br>
	Function overloading: C++ enables several functions of the same name to be defined, as long as these functions have different sets of parameters (at least as far as their types are concerned). This capability is called function overloading. When an overloaded function is called, the C++ compiler selects the proper function by examining the number, types and order of the arguments in the call. Function overloading is commonly used to create several functions of the same name that perform similar tasks but on different data types.<br>
	Operator overloading allows existing C++ operators to be redefined so that they work on objects of user-defined classes. Overloaded operators are syntactic sugar for equivalent function calls. They form a pleasant facade that doesn't add anything fundamental to the language (but they can improve understandability and reduce maintenance costs).</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">16.what is friend function?</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><u><b><font color="#000000">A friend function </font> </b> </u>for a class is used in object-oriented programming to allow access to public, private, or protected data in the class from the outside.<br>
	Normally, a function that is not a member of a class cannot access such information; neither can an external class. Occasionally, such access will be advantageous for the programmer. Under these circumstances, the function or external class can be declared as a friend of the class using the friend keyword.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>17.What do you mean by inline function?</b></font><br>
	<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">The idea behind inline functions is to insert the code of a called function at the point where the function is called. If done carefully, this can improve the application's performance in exchange for increased compile time and possibly (but not always) an increase in the size of the generated binary executables.</span><br>
	<br>
	<font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">18. <b> Tell me something about abstract classes?</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">An abstract class is a class which does not fully represent an object. Instead, it represents a broad range of different classes of objects. However, this representation extends only to the features that those classes of objects have in common. Thus, an abstract class provides only a partial description of its objects.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><b style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">19</b><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">.</span><b style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">What is the difference between realloc() and free()?</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">The free subroutine frees a block of memory previously allocated by the malloc subroutine. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer. If the Pointer parameter is a null value, no action will occur. The realloc subroutine changes the size of the block of memory pointed to by the Pointer parameter to the number of bytes specified by the Size parameter and returns a new pointer to the block. The pointer specified by the Pointer parameter must have been created with the malloc, calloc, or realloc subroutines and not been deallocated with the free or realloc subroutines. Undefined results occur if the Pointer parameter is not a valid pointer.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>20.What is the difference between an array and a list?</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">Array is collection of homogeneous elements. List is collection of heterogeneous elements.</span><br>
	<font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">For Array memory allocated is static and continuous. For List memory allocated is dynamic and Random.<br>
	Array: User need not have to keep in track of next memory allocation.<br>
	List: User has to keep in Track of next location where memory is allocated.<br>
	Array uses direct access of stored members, list uses sequential access for members.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">21.What are the differences between structures and arrays?</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Arrays is a group of similar data types but Structures can be group of different data types</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><br>
	<font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">22.<b>What is data structure?</b></font><br>
	<span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data.</span></p>

	<font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>24.What are the advantages of inheritance?</b><br>
	<br>
	It permits code reusability. Reusability saves time in program development. It encourages the reuse of proven and debugged high-quality software, thus reducing problem after a system becomes functional.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><br>
	<font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>25. what are the two integrity rules used in DBMS?</b> </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">The two types of&nbsp; integrity rules are referential integrity rules and entity integrity rules. Referential integrity rules dictate that a database does not contain orphan foreign key values. This means that&nbsp;<br>
	A primary key value cannot be modified if the value is used as a foreign key in a child table. Entity integrity dictates that the primary key value cannot be Null.<br>
	<br>
	<b>26. Tell something about deadlock and how can we prevent dead lock?</b> </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">In an operating system, a deadlock is a situation which occurs when a process enters a waiting state because a resource requested by it is being held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource. If a process is unable to change its state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used by other waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be non-shareable.[1] Only one process can use the resource at any given instant of time.<br>
	Hold and Wait or Resource Holding: A process is currently holding at least one resource and requesting additional resources which are being held by other processes.<br>
	No Preemption: The operating system must not de-allocate resources once they have been allocated; they must be released by the holding process voluntarily.<br>
	Circular Wait: A process must be waiting for a resource which is being held by another process, which in turn is waiting for the first process to release the resource. In general, there is a set of waiting processes, P = {P1, P2, ..., PN}, such that P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, P2 is waiting for a resource held by P3 and so on till PN is waiting for a resource held by P1.[1][7]<br>
	<br>
	Thus prevention of deadlock is possible by ensuring that at least one of the four conditions cannot hold.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">&nbsp;A doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of the list. If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node. It can be conceptualized as two singly linked lists formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">Abstraction is the process of recognizing and focusing on important characteristics of a situation or object and leaving/filtering out the un-wanted characteristics of that situation or object.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Lets take a person as example and see how that person is abstracted in various situations<br>
	<br>
	A doctor sees (abstracts) the person as patient. The doctor is interested in name, height, weight, age, blood group, previous or existing diseases etc of a person<br>
	An employer sees (abstracts) a person as Employee. The employer is interested in name, age, health, degree of study, work experience etc of a person.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Abstraction is the basis for software development. Its through abstraction we define the essential aspects of a system. The process of identifying the abstractions for a given system is called as Modeling (or object modeling).</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Three levels of data abstraction are:<br>
	1. Physical level : how the data is stored physically and where it is stored in database.<br>
	2. Logical level : what information or data is stored in the database. eg: Database administrator<br>
	3.View level : end users work on view level. if any amendment is made it can be saved by other name.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">A conversion constructor is a single-parameter constructor that is declared without the function specifier 'explicit'. The compiler uses conversion constructors to convert objects from the type of the first parameter to the type of the conversion constructor's class.To define implicit conversions, C++ uses conversion constructors, constructors that accept a single parameter and initialize an object to be a copy of that parameter.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">If you want to get information on all the techniques of designing, maintaining, building and retrieving data, Data warehousing is the ideal method. A data warehouse is premeditated and generated for supporting the decision making process within an organization. </font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><font color="#008000">Here are some of the benefits of a data warehouse:</font><br>
	<br>
	o With data warehousing, you can provide a common data model for different interest areas regardless of data's source. In this way, it becomes easier to report and analyze information.<br>
	<br>
	o Many inconsistencies are identified and resolved before loading of information in data warehousing. This makes the reporting and analyzing process simpler.<br>
	<br>
	o The best part of data warehousing is that the information is under the control of users, so that in case the system gets purged over time, information can be easily and safely stored for longer time period.<br>
	<br>
	o Because of being different from operational systems, a data warehouse helps in retrieving data without slowing down the operational system.<br>
	<br>
	o Data warehousing enhances the value of operational business applications and customer relationship management systems.<br>
	<br>
	o Data warehousing also leads to proper functioning of support system applications like trend reports, exception reports and the actual performance analyzing reports.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">a) A recursive function is a function which calls itself.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">b) The speed of a recursive program is slower because of stack overheads. (This attribute is evident if you run above C program.)<br>
	c) A recursive function must have recursive conditions, terminating conditions, and recursive expressions.<br>
	<br>
	Stack data structure . Because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property it remembers its caller so knows whom to return when the function has to return. Recursion makes use of system stack for storing the return addresses of the function calls. Every recursive function has its equivalent iterative (non-recursive) function. Even when such equivalent iterative procedures are written, explicit stack is to be used.<br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>49.What do you know about the garbage collector?</b><br>
	<br>
	Garbage collection is the systematic recovery of pooled computer storage that is being used by a program when that program no longer needs the storage. This frees the storage for use by other programs&nbsp;<br>
	(or processes within a program). It also ensures that a program using increasing amounts of pooled storage does not reach its quota (in which case it may no longer be able to function).&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	Garbage collection is an automatic memory management feature in many modern programming languages, such as Java and languages in the .NET framework. Languages that use garbage collection are often interpreted or run within a virtual machine like the JVM. In each case, the environment that runs the code is also responsible for garbage collection.</font></p>
