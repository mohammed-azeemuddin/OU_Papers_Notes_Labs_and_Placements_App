<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">1.Difference between C and C++?</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">a) C follows the procedural programming paradigm while C++ is a multi-paradigm language (procedural as well as object oriented)<br>
	In case of C, importance is given to the steps or procedure of the program while C++ focuses on the data rather than the process.<br>
	Also, it is easier to implement/edit the code in case of C++ for the same reason.<br>
	b) In case of C, the data is not secured while the data is secured (hidden) in C++<br>
	This difference is due to specific OOP features like Data Hiding which are not present in C.<br>
	c) C is a low-level language while C++ is a middle-level language<br>
	C is regarded as a low-level language (difficult interpretation &amp; less user friendly) while C++ has features of both low-level (concentration on what's going on in the machine hardware) &amp; high-level languages (concentration on the program itself) &amp; hence is regarded as a middle-level language.<br>
	d) C uses the top-down approach while C++ uses the bottom-up approach<br>
	In case of C, the program is formulated step by step, each step is processed into detail while in C++, the base elements are first formulated which then are linked together to give rise to larger systems.<br>
	e) C is function-driven while C++ is object-driven<br>
	Functions are the building blocks of a C program while objects are building blocks of a C++ program.<br>
	f) C++ supports function overloading while C does not<br>
	Overloading means two functions having the same name in the same program. This can be done only in C++ with the help of Polymorphism (an OOP feature)<br>
	g) We can use functions inside structures in C++ but not in C.<br>
	In case of C++, functions can be used inside a structure while structures cannot contain functions in C.<br>
	h) The NAMESPACE feature in C++ is absent in case of C<br>
	C++ uses NAMESPACE which avoid name collisions. For instance, two students enrolled in the same university cannot have the same roll number while two students in different universities might have the same roll number. The universities are two different namespace &amp; hence contain the same roll number (identifier) but the same university (one namespace) cannot have two students with the same roll number (identifier)<br>
	i) The standard input &amp; output functions differ in the two languages<br>
	C uses scanf &amp; printf while C++ uses cin&gt;&gt; &amp; cout&lt;&lt; as their respective input &amp; output functions<br>
	j) C++ allows the use of reference variables while C does not<br>
	Reference variables allow two variable names to point to the same memory location. We cannot use these variables in C programming.<br>
	k) C++ supports Exception Handling while C does not.<br>
	C does not support it "formally" but it can always be implemented by other methods. Though you don't have the framework to throw &amp; catch exceptions as in C++.<br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><o:p><b>2.What is null pointer?</b></o:p></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">When referring to computer memory, a null pointer is a command used to direct a software program or operating system to an empty location in the computer memory. Commonly, the null pointer is used to denote the end of a memory search or processing event. In computer programming, a null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any object or function.<br>
	A nil pointer is a false value. For example, 1 &gt; 2 is a nil statement.<br>
	In the programming language C, NULL is an available command that can be used, where nil is an available command used in the Pascal programming language.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">An object-relational database (ORD), or object-relational database management system (ORDBMS), is a database management system (DBMS) similar to a relational database, but with an object-oriented database model: objects, classes and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language. In addition, just as with proper relational systems, it supports extension of the data model with custom data-types and methods.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Btree<br>
	It is made of branch nodes and leaf nodes. Branch nodes holds prefix key value along with the link to the leaf node. The leaf node in turn contains the indexed value and rowed.<br>
	Bitmap<br>
	It simply consists of bits for every single distinct value. It uses a string of bits to quickly locate rows in a table. Used to index low cardinality columns.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Clustered Index<br>
	Only one per table<br>
	Faster to read than non clustered as data is physically stored in index order<br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">14.How can u increase the heap size in the memory?</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">If heap size set too low then you will get "out of memory" errors. If you set it too high then your system will hang or you will suffer poor performance because parts of the jvm will be swapped in and out of memory. A rule of thumb is that you should not set this parameter larger than about 80% of your free physical memory. On Windows XP machines you can determine your free physical memory from the Performance tab of the Task Manager application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">Boosting the heap size parameter will allow you to read in larger file-based projects. It will also improve the performance of the database back-end since more memory is available for caching.In Java Set the maximum heap size, using the -Xmx command-line option, to a value that allows the application to run with 70% occupancy of the Java heap.The Java heap occupancy often varies over time as the load applied to the application varies. For applications where occupancy varies, set the maximum Java heap size so that there is 70% occupancy at the highest point, and set the minimum heap size, using the -Xms command line option, so that the Java heap is 40% occupied at its lowest memory usage. If these values are set, the Java memory management algortihms can modify the heap size over time according to the application load, while maintaining usage in the optimal area of between 40% and 70% occupancy.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><o:p><b>15.Why is it difficult to store linked list in an array?</b></o:p></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: medium; line-height: 150%;">Both Arrays and Linked List can be used to store linear data of similar types.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Linked list provide dynamic size while the size of array is fixed, So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance.<br>
	Linked lists have following drawbacks:<br>
	1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists.<br>
	2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.<br>
	3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.</font></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">The <b> JOIN</b> keyword is used in an SQL statement to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.<br>
	Tables in a database are often related to each other with keys.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">A <b> view</b> is a virtual table.A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.<br>

<p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"><b>Normalization</b> is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. There are two goals of the normalization process: eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table) and ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored.&nbsp;</font><br>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Meet all the requirements of the third normal form.<br>
	A relation is in 4NF if it has no multi-valued dependencies.<br>
	Remember, these normalization guidelines are cumulative. For a database to be in 2NF, it must first fulfill all the criteria of a 1NF database.<br>
	In a DBMS, a <b> trigger </b> is a SQL procedure that initiates an action (i.e., fires an action) when an event (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE) occurs. Since triggers are event-driven specialized procedures, they are stored in and managed by the DBMS. A trigger cannot be called or executed; the DBMS automatically fires the trigger as a result of a data modification to the associated table. Triggers are used to maintain the referential integrity of data by changing the data in a systematic fashion. Each trigger is attached to a single, specified table in the database.&nbsp;</font><br>
